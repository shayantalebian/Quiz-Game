# Quiz Game

This is a simple quiz game built with Python to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The game is designed to help users improve their understanding of OOP concepts in a fun and interactive way.

## How it works

The game presents the user with a series of True or False questions. The user must input their answer, and their score will be calculated based on the number of correct responses. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible.

**The whole goal is to score as high as posible.**

## More About this project

This project was created to practice Python OOP in a practical, real-world scenario by developing an intermediate-level game. The inspiration for this project originated from one of the challenges in my [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). The goal is to enhance understanding and application of OOP principles through an engaging and interactive quiz game.
